# Project 0 covers the following:

1. Instructions on how to set up Python,
2. Workflow examples,
3. A mini-Python tutorial
4. Project grading: Every project’s release includes its autograder that you can run locally to debug. When you submit, the same autograder is ran.

Files to Edit and Submit: You will fill in portions of addition.py, buyLotsOfFruit.py, and shopSmart.py during the assignment. Once you have completed the assignment, you will submit these files to Gradescope (for instance, you can upload all .py files in the folder). Please do not change the other files in this distribution.

Evaluation: Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please do not change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation – not the autograder’s judgements – will be the final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your work.
