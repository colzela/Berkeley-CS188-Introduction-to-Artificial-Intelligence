# Project 5: Machine Learning

This project will be an introduction to machine learning; you will build a neural network to classify digits, and more!

|Files you'll edit:| |
|:---|-----|
```models.py```|	Perceptron and neural network models for a variety of applications.
**Files you might want to look at:**
```nn.py```|	Neural network mini-library.
**Supporting files you can ignore:**
```autograder.py```|	Project autograder.
```backend.py```|	Backend code for various machine learning tasks.
```data```|	Datasets for digit classification and language identification.
